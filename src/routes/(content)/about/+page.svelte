  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm Vijay! I have been coding my whole life and working as a professional
    software engineer for over 10 years at some of the best companies in the world.
    I'm primarily a backend engineer although I'm starting to dabble in frontend
    (hence this website). Links to my various profiles can be found below.
